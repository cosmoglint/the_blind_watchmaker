The Blind Watchmaker:

  You are the selector, and decide which organism gets to see the next generation. random factors change the organism a little bit every generation, such that only those with features that please you as the selector survive subsequent generations evolve those features that help them survive.

  Change the rate of mutations by altering the mutation rate value in watch.js file
